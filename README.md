## 📖About me
Hello! My name is Piotr Tarach, I'm a driven and passionate IT professional with hands-on experience in software testing tools and techniques. Ever since childhood, I've been fascinated by information technology and have dedicated myself to pursuing my passion by entering the IT sector.

Through a combination of professional and self-education, I've gained experience in the latest software testing methods and tools, allowing me to learn how to the success of any project I'm a part of. I'm now eager to join a team of like-minded professionals who share my dedication to delivering top-notch software products that meet the highest quality standards and satisfy even the most demanding clients.

I have completed a comprehensive Software Testing course that provided me with a solid foundation in theoretical and practical aspects of Software Quality Assurance. I'm familiar with testing principles, various levels and types of testing, and static and dynamic test design techniques. I've also mastered essential testing tools like bug and test case management tools and have tested websites, banking applications, and online games platforms.

Additionally, I have a strong grasp of database fundamentals using MySQL and programming basics, including object-oriented programming in Java. My knowledge of Agile Project Management employing Scrum methodology and Behavior Driven Development methodology, along with Selenium WebDriver tool, allows me to execute tasks with ease and precision.

I'm a quick learner, constantly striving to expand my skillset. In my spare time, I'm learning Java and gaining commercial experience on uTest. My ultimate goal is to become an automation tester and excel in Java programming.

I'm eager to take on new challenges and contribute my skills to a dynamic team of professionals. Let's work together to create cutting-edge software products that exceed our clients' expectations!
